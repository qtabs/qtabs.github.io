OR: "A cheesy short entry in English inspired by a sentence translated to Spanish from the original German written by JW (the great Saxonian Romantic)"

In the best impersonation of JW's spiritual mantras, our sight of interpersonal romantic relationships precisely aligns towards passion or reason depending on the current state of our (mostly unfortunate) love affairs.

When love lays in the top, claiming its reign, reason rest overthrown, in a solitary hill, and fog runs freely over the realms of the intellect, filling it with doubt and uncertainty; a still bright clairvoyance seems to fall upon, granting the contaminated spirit the power to observe the actions of the past selves (and the current others) with the critical eye of the enlightened. 

Like a bored creature snooping across the TV channels hoping for a film or maybe a show able to fill his empty soul with a moment of quiet entertaining, the unlovings sniff around on strangers, grasping on a piece of hope for a lurking passion that might unravel a prospective love to dream upon. And like those unbearable couples wondering around IKEA looking for the perfect couch to complete their living room, so do the unlovings wander in their catalogues of singles, hoping to find the handsome human that might look the best filling the empty place of their oversized beds. The unavoidably judgemental victims of love cannot stop wonder: what is the point of pursuing love, when love does not seem to desist on pursuing you?

But so does reason maybe rule on a far region where love, tired an consumed after a long taxing adventure, rests wrapped in a woollen blanked, eyes fixated in a mellow fire, feet tingling between the crisp clothing of a freshly made bed.

How absurd might appear, for those for whom reason is not being denied, the childish attitude of the corny wonderers who helplessly felt in love for an unlikely partner. Lost in the irrationality of an impossible quest absent of joy and of impossible redemption, these preposterous critters remain trapped like a hamster in a ridged wheel unable to find the way out that is so obviously salient for the outside observers. What is the point of having fallen in love, shall the rational agents ask, when that love is inconvenient? Is it not more optimal to look for love within a preselected subset of couches, that nicely fit in the empty space of your living room? Is not love, after all, a social construct?

And still both populations intermingle. They have lunch together, and maybe even tea. And a hundred naps later, might the Werthers be sweeping tinder nostalgic of their lost passions, and the Alberts trapped in the Hamster's wheel desperate to take back their illusory freedom; for what is uncalled is never wanted, and what can be romanticised will always be calling.
