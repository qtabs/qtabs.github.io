Greek meze: Grilled prawns with a strong anis aroma, feta, and tomato sauce. It sounds strange but it all blends together really well.

### Ingredients ###
500g peeled prawns  
125g feta  
1 onion  
2 garlic cloves
2 red chillies  
1 bunch of parsley  
5 large peeled tomatoes  
olive oil  
paprika  
anise liquor  


### Instructions ###
Mince the garlic, finely chop the onion and chillies. Coarsely grate the tomatoes. Chop the parsley. Preheat the oven's grill to maximum temperature.

Stir fry in generous olive oil the onions and garlic at low heat until brown. Increase the heat and add the paprika and anise liquor. Add the tomatoes, lower down the heat, and saut√© for about 15 minutes. Correct for salt at this stage, taking into account the feta will also contribute.

Remove the pan from the heat. Add the prawns and feta on the top. Place the pan under the grill until the prawns are browned (up to 10 minutes). Take out from the oven, add the parsley, stir it altogether. Serve.
